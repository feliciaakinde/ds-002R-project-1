Project 1 task: Create a quarto website with a home page, about page, and two data visualizations.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width = 12}
library(tidytuesdayR)
library(tidyverse)

# imports data from tidytuesday
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2024, week = 20)

# renames data
coffee_survey <- tuesdata$coffee_survey

# removes NAs from variables age and favorite
cleaned_coffee_survey <- coffee_survey |>
  filter(!is.na(age) & !is.na(favorite))

# creates a new data frame with age and favorite, counts the occurrences of each favorite per age group
data_summary <- cleaned_coffee_survey |>
  group_by(age, favorite) |>
  summarize(count = n(), .groups = 'drop')

# creates proportion, which is the percentage of favorite in age 
coffee_survey3 <- data_summary |>
  group_by(age)  |>
  mutate(proportion = count / sum(count, na.rm = TRUE))

# makes graph
ggplot(coffee_survey3, 
       aes(x = favorite, y = proportion, fill = favorite)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  facet_wrap(~ age) +
    
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::percent) +
  labs(
    x = "Favorite Way to Drink Coffee",
    y = "Percentage",
    title = "Favorite Ways to Drink Coffee Across Different Age Groups",
  )+
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
  )
```
alt txt: Seven bar charts representing each age group showing their favorite ways to drink coffee. The colors of the bars represents the coffee preferences, and the y-axis shows the percentage of respondents, formatted as percentages.
