The TidyTuesday Project is a collection of data frames, released every week from 2018 to present day. The data collected in these frames are endless, with data quantifying Olympic Medals to data describing Himalayan Climbers. The project is open to anyone and everyone, and it aims to provide opportunities for individuals to learn how to work with real-world data sets through data science."
