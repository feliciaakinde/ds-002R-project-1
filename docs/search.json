The TidyTuesday Project is a collection of data frames, released every week from 2018 to present day. The data collected in these frames are endless, with data quantifying Olympic Medals to data describing Himalayan Climbers. The project is open to anyone and everyone, and it aims to provide opportunities for individuals to learn how to work with real-world data sets through data science."

Line graph of the probability of exactly one pair in a hand. The greatest probability is seen at 5 cards in a hand, and progressively decreases as hand size decreases.\nThis plot can be useful when playing card games that depend on probability. A notable example is in the card game poker, where players each have 5-card hands, and place different kinds of bets. Typically they are based on what cards they think their opponents are holding, the likelihood of certain hands being dealt, and the probabilities of drawing favorable cards to improve their own hand. A one-pair hand is seen as low value, and looking at this graph, relatively common.\nTo conquer this problem, I used an abundance of math, mostly using the factorial() function. With this, I was able to successfully calibrate the probabilities of picking up exactly one pair in hands of varying sizes. Lastly, a representation of the data was graphed using ggplot to visually represent the probabilities."
