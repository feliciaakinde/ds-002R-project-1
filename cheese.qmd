Project 1 task: Create a quarto website with a home page, about page, and two data visualizations.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# imports data from tidytuesday
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2024, week = 23)

  mutate(calcium_content = as.numeric(calcium_content))

# creates a new data point if there is more than one animal in milk

alt txt: Heat map showing calcium content by color (y-axis) and type of milk (x-axis). Each tile is color-coded based on calcium content: yellow for 0-50, light green for 50-100, green for 100-200, cyan for 200-500, blue for 500-1000, and dark blue for 1000-5000.
